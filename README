OVERVIEW
========

A series of demos showcasing the basic use of OpenGL 2.


DEPENDENCIES
============

This project requires OpenGL 2, GLU, and GLUT. On debian-based systems, these
utilities can all be installed through the freeglut3-dev package.


COMPILING
=========

This package places the needed headers at GL/glut.h. This behavior is not
necessarily consistent across all systems, and so the appropriate #include
statements may need to be modified by hand before compiling.

This project is built using make. By default, all demos will be compiled when
make is run.


RUNNING
=======

This project is run via the included bash script.

Alternatively, each individual demo can be run by running the appropriate
executable.

Each demo can be configured via commandline options. For a complete list of
options, run a demo with the '-?' option.
